        <h1>Rock Paper Scissors</h1>
           <h2>Rules of the game</h2>
           <p>Players count together out loud, “Rock... Scissors... Paper... One... Two... Three,” while pumping their fists. On the count of “Three”, they simultaneously show with their hand one of three signs: stone, scissors or paper. Two players must place scissors at the beginning, followed by any other symbol.
           <p>The winner is determined according to the following rules:</p>
           <p>Paper beats stone</p>
           <p>Rock beats scissors</p>
           <p>Scissors beat paper</p>
           <p>If the players show the same sign, then the game is considered a draw and the game is replayed.
            In the classic version, the game is played by two people, but it is possible to play with more participants. In this case, a draw is counted in a situation when all three gestures appeared in the company of players, or if all players showed the same sign.
